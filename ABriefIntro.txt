I've started Andrew Ng's machine learning coursera course on 07/03/2024.
My goal is to submit my code and other conceptual work to fufill the course requirements and expectations.
We'll be reviewing a multitude of ML topics, spanning across the following whirlwind of categories :

(A) Diagnosing diseases from hospital image scans or X-Ray Scans
(B) Detecting defects in nearRT in factory assembly line products
(C) Optimizing power generation and power distribution
